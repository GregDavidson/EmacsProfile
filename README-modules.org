* NGender Emacs Extensions Directory

Except where explicit calls to require indicate
dependencies, the modules (files) in this directory stand
alone.  You will want to arrange for their loading in your
[[file:~/emacs.d/init.el][User-Me/init-me.el]] file, either with an explicit require or
by arranging an autoload.

Most of these "modules" are in a very primitive state.  They
were recently ripped out of the context of traditional large
personal customization files.  We're learning how these
kinds of files should be written so that they are maximally
independent, robust and resilient.
