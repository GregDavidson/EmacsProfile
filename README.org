* Emacs Profile Ideas

This is an old mess from before I moved to Spacemacs, /except for/

- [[file:org-capture.el][org-capture.el]] :: my org-capture set up

Note that the files under ~/Notes/GTD folder (or wherever you put them) have to
already exist and have the assumed OrgMode structure for org-capture to work.

- [[file:.spacemacs][.spacemacs]] :: my spacemacs settings

May contain useful clues on how to set up Org-Babel for various programs.
