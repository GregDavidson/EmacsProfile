* Emacs Configuration Directory: ~/.emacs.d

This directory is managed with git.
It is expected to work on any account with an up-to-date Emacs
This means that any host-specific features need to be expressed conditionally!

Notes:

1. It's expected that ~/.emacs links to ~/.emacs.d/.emacs
2. (setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/custom-file.el")

Problems:

1. There are some host-specific parts of various files, e.g.
jgd/jgd-sql-connect.el

2. custom-file.el
- Customization settings changes seem rather unstable
- I'd rather have some of these in my .el files
- How am I going to curate & propagage changes to this file?

3. I should split the parts of this which apply to jgd from the
parts which might work well for anyone.

4. How do I ensure that byte-recompilation happens automatically?

I could use (byte-recompile-directory) with suitable options
when I start my emacs server.
