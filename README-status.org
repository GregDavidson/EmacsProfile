* Status of NGender Emacs Prelude Project

** Overall Status: Rough

- Some modules are good enough for now.
- Many modules are unreliable
- ngender-example needs to show the way

** Roadmap

Let's dump cl-lib in favor of seq.  Let's not pull in
dash, despite its beauty.

What other now built-in packages would be helpful?
